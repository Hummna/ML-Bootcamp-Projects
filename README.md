# ML-Bootcamp-Projects

Welcome Machine Learning Enthusiasts!
This repository contains two projects completed during my participation in a Machine Learning bootcamp. Additionally, it includes Excel files containing the data used in these projects.

## Project Descriptions

1. **Regression Project for Medical Insurance Forecast**
   - **Description:** This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs using regression techniques. The goal was to develop a model that accurately forecasts insurance expenses based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, etc.
   - **Files:**
     - `Medical_Insurance_Forecast.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for Project A.
     - `insurance.csv`: Excel file containing the dataset used in Project A.

2. **Loan Eligibility Prediction Classification Project**
   - **Description:** In this project, we aimed to predict loan eligibility based on various factors using classification algorithms. The objective was to build a model that determines whether an individual is eligible for a loan or not based on features like income, credit score, loan amount, etc.
   - **Files:**
     - `Loan-Eligibility-Prediction.py`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for Project B.
     - `loan_data_set.csv`: Excel file containing the dataset used in Project B.
